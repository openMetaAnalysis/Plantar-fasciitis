Ultrasonic shock waves for plantar fasciitis
====================
A data-only living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that the intervention is effective. However, meta-regression shows no dose-response relationship, blinding is difficult, and no registration numbers are found for the trials. GRADE methodology has not been applied to this review.

* [Reconciliation of conclusions with prior meta-analyses](../../tree/master/reconciliation-tables) 

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analyses.(1-4) All studies with at least 100 total patients are included. Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This repository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:

* [Reconciliation of studies included with other meta-analyses](../../tree/master/reconciliation-tables) 
* [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))

The forest plot for the primary outcome is below. Additional [forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) of secondary analyses may be available.
